This project trains a spacy domain specific model on harry potter text, this allows the model to detect named entity in the data which pertains to harry potter 
literature.

The project is divided into three parts 

1. 01_create_name_entities.ipynb : we create custom named entities to be fed to the model.
2. 02_create_train_set.ipynb: we create the training dataset with the custom named entitie.
3. 03_train_the_model.ipynb: we train and test the model on unseen data.
